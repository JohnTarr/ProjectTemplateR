-  From the Active project folder, execute the below line:
	git clone https://github.com/JohnTarr/ProjectTemplateR
- Rename the folder to the project name
- Delete the .git folder, so it isn't linking to the template project
- Rename the RMD file under Code/R
- Open RStudio and create a new project in an existing directory
- Pick the new directory you just created
- All the rest of the details are in the RMD file you renamed
